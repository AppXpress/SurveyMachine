Developer Site FEF Example Code

Example FEF web application built for the developer site to use as a code example

This repository contains the FEF source code, a zip file of the FEF bundle, and a zip file that 
contains the complete platform module.

To mess around with the UI produced by this code, simply upload the platform module and give your
user rights to the custom objects.
